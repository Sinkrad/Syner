The left navigation namely the Area and Tag navigation doesn't look at that great and I'm still looking for for some better methods to have it blend with the rest of the layout.  The css is only covering gradients for webkit(chrome) and mozilla for the moment, the IE declarations are not working yet. Each page has a quick explanation describing how the page works.  I know the work is a bit rushed and un-organized but I'll be back to update this after the weekend. 

Even though I've spent a bit of time on the css formatting, keep in mind that a lot of the id and class names are not set up right.  Since I started build the pages with html it would be a hassle to go back and change all the values to suit well named/structured css declarations so that will be fixed in the future.  

I wanted to focus on the feel of the site in terms of browsing from section to section and less on the contents of each page.  I've typed in some simple explanations but all in it all its there just to give a feel and to allow you guys to improve upon/critique it.  

I know the html and css quality isn't professional but hey, this is my first time working with css.

I've cleaned up the CSS some more and changed the logo.  I got rid of the logo icon and just have the text centered.  If you hover over the logo it'll display a green underline so people know its clickable.

You can reach to new logo from the index page, see the link at the bottom of the content area.

Also I forgot to mention some functionality with the headnav and area nav.  If a user selects "search" and then selects an area, say country, if they go back and select "peak" they do not get returned to global as default, whatever current area they have selected it would remain that way until they change it.  The area that they select would also stay selected after they have selected a Topic, this way the menu passively tells the user what area the topic is located within.  Another thing we could try and I wanted to get your input on is having the area selection change whenever a user clicks on a link to another problem that happens to be in a different Area.  Should the area menu change to select that area to as the user is looking at it?
