				<p>This is somewhat of a grey area for me.  I'm not sure if we should give the Problem vote option its own page.  I want to say no because there is a bit of redunancy with its usage, yet at the same time we may want some more visual aspect that belong to the vote option.  I figure we have three ways to handle it:</p>
				<p>1. We give the vote option its own page, likely giving itself some more room for visuals or extra features.<br />
				2. We place the vote option at the top of the Topic's naviation.  Something like this image:<a href="vote_option.jpg">embed the voting option within the navigation</a><br />
				3. Or we can place the voting option with in the action page.  The action page does already have 3 features embedded within it, but I think it would encourage to user to study the history of the issue prior to voting for it. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Either way I'm not exactly sure how to solve this issue.</b>

				<p>After talking to Justin I think we've figured out a pretty good solution.  Maybe we should embed the voting function within the top part of the Solutions page.  This would reduce a menu item for us, and I think it would be good to keep the function near the solutions for the problem so users can atleast glance at proposed solutions before deciding if the problem is really a problem or not.  We also brought up the difference between how we should encourage users to vote on a problem.  We could either specify that they vote on a problem due to its REAL status in the world (being solved or not) or its THEORETICAL solution status (whether a viable solution has been recognized or not.  We decided that it would be better to make sure to let the user know that they're voting on the REAL status of the problem's state, and not the theory.  This way problems that are still a real problem in the world remain at the top of the rankings rather than problems that just can't be figured out.  (Difference being Global Warming which has a lot of theoretical solutions but they haven't all been implemented yet, and a problem like ,"Black Hole Might Swallow Earth."  Which would be a problem that has relatively few theoretical solutions yet isn't exactly a real problem that is affecting a lot of people (realistically). </p>
