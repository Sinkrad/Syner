				Now the user has access to their account settings and home page.  Even though you can see those options within the navigation I'm going to explain their content here rather than spend time on putting the content within each page:<br /><br />
				Within the settings area a user can set their real name if they choose to.  They can also set their default location.  Any specific account settings such as enable/disable email notifcation from updates.  Profile picture, stuff like that.  Justin mentioned liking having a personal icon, or being able to see a persons face.  I think that would be a great idea as it helps to enforce that this web-site is interacting with REAL people.  I think there would be a lot less flaming when you get to see the others person face.  This is not required.  But maybe we should make it a requirement for the icon picture to be a picture of them, or nothing at all?<br /><br />
				Next is the Home page.  This place is the hub for users to catch up on any problems that they are currently subscribed to.  A user is subscribed to a problem is they created it or manual subscribe to one.  A subscription allows the user to follow a Topic as it gets editted to watch its progress.  I'm sure there are some additional features we could implement within the Home page to allow the user to stay connected with problems they're interacting with.
